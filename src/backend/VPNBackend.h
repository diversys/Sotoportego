// Abstract interface every VPN implementation (OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPSec, ...)
// must satisfy. A backend is owned by the daemon and lives inside the daemon's
// BLooper, so it derives from BHandler: that lets it receive its own timer
// (BMessageRunner) ticks and other async events via MessageReceived(), without
// each backend having to invent its own threading.
//
// Route and DNS management are deliberately NOT part of this interface: they
// will be a shared service of the daemon (see Milestone 2), invoked the same
// way regardless of backend, rather than reimplemented per backend.
//
// Threading: all methods are expected to be called from the daemon's looper
// thread (i.e. with the looper locked, as is the case inside MessageReceived).
